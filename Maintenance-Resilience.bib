  abstract = {Ottobre 2018 - Le immagini raccontano la sperimentazione di "ispezione digitale" effettuata nelle gallerie lungo la strada statale 685, al confine tra Marche e Umbria.  Si tratta di una tecnologia innovativa messa a punto in collaborazione con Leica Geosystems Italia. Il progetto prevede la realizzazione di un sistema integrato di sensori capaci di acquisire ad altissima risoluzione immagini e geometrie di tutta la galleria, nonch\'e lo sviluppo di nuove piattaforme software di analisi dei dati acquisiti. Immagini e misure sono infatti elaborate sia per essere utilizzate da un algoritmo ad intelligenza artificiale per il riconoscimento di difetti e anomalie dell'opera, sia per ricostruire sotto forma di realt\`a virtuale l'ambiente galleria e trasferirlo in ufficio (attraverso un visore VR) per poter poi essere visitato e analizzato da occhi esperti in qualsiasi momento e ogni volta che se ne ha la necessit\`a. L'acquisizione dei dati avviene attraverso un mezzo stradale che prevede l'installazione fissa di videocamere ad altissima risoluzione, sistemi di illuminazione e sistemi di rilievo di precisione delle geometrie delle gallerie. Tale configurazione consente l'utilizzo del mezzo in qualsiasi condizione di luce, senza l'interruzione della circolazione in totale sicurezza per il traffico e per gli operatori. Il sistema di riconoscimento delle immagini  \`e di tipo machine learning ossia migliora la risposta man mano che la quantit\`a di informazioni disponibili cresce e quindi produttivit\`a e affidabilit\`a miglioreranno tanto pi\`u velocemente quanto pi\`u sar\`a possibile utilizzare questi strumenti.}

  abstract = {Existing infrastructure needs major investment (photo: Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office) Governor Cuomo traveled to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Trump, where he pitched the president on infrastructure investments like an expanded Second Avenue Subway and a new Penn Station. The governor is right to push for a national public works program, which would get thousands of newly unemployed Americans working again while tackling urgent infrastructure needs.~ The last time the nation embarked on a major public works program, it produced dozens of large-scale projects in New York that helped dig the city and the country out of the Great Depression\textemdash from the RFK Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel, and LaGuardia Airport to post offices, hospitals, high schools, and swimming pools across every borough. A bold public works program would give New York a similar boost during these devastating economic times. But New York's infrastructure needs are different than they were during the 1930s. Today, what the city needs most is a massive campaign to upgrade and maintain the infrastructure it already has.~ For decades, New York City has fallen behind the mounting state-of-good-repair needs of its crumbling public infrastructure, with serious consequences for the city's livability and long-term health. For instance, while building new miles of subway is a worthy goal, the urgent need is to stabilize the current system. Fixing the city's crumbling subways and modernizing the bus system will require at least \$40 billion over the next five years, including \$7 billion just to upgrade decades-old signals and cut down on delays. These investments can restore confidence in public transit in a moment of crisis\textemdash and with the system shut at night and the city on lockdown, now is the time to get to work. New York City's aging infrastructure needs extend far beyond public transit. The city's beleaguered public housing\textemdash home to a disproportionate share of residents impacted by the current crisis\textemdash is waiting on more than \$31 billion in urgent infrastructure repairs, including crucial fixes to moldering apartments and crumbling facades.~ The city's average public hospital\textemdash essential to the pandemic response\textemdash is over 57 years old, and the system is staring down nearly \$400 million in critical repair and maintenance costs. The city's public parks\textemdash especially vital now that New Yorkers have few other options for recreation and exercise\textemdash are more than 73 years old, on average, and face more than \$634 million in needs, including decaying drainage systems, crumbling retaining walls, and disintegrating bulkheads.~ Parks are far from the city's only green infrastructure challenges. Thousands of acres of concrete and asphalt need to be greened to reduce stormwater runoff. And meeting the city's ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require fast-tracked upgrades to retrofit far more public buildings.~ Many of these assets receive little notice until they fail. Over the past decade, the city has averaged 459 water main breaks annually, more than one per day. The number of fracture-critical bridges jumped from 47 in 2012 to at least 67 in 2018.~ Add to the list the stunning repair needs affecting the city's public schools, colleges, and libraries\textemdash institutions that provide a sense of community in neighborhoods citywide, while preparing New Yorkers to participate in the economic recovery. The Department of Education has nearly \$2.5 billion in urgent, short-term capital needs, with over \$100 million more at CUNY's community colleges. And the city's three public library systems\textemdash where the average branch library is more than 65 years old\textemdash are facing nearly \$900 million in capital expenses to overhaul aging branches, replace leaky roofs, fix broken boilers, and upgrade HVAC systems. In addition, these institutions and many others need major upgrades to expand broadband access and help close the city's persistent digital divide. As the city at the epicenter of a national catastrophe, New York will need a historic level of federal investment to restore livelihoods and restart the country's largest local economy, with lasting benefits for the nation and the world. Investing in infrastructure is a vital place to start.~ But in a city as old as New York, the first priority should be repairing, restoring, and modernizing the aging infrastructure that we've already got. There's no shortage of shovel-ready work to do. ***Jonathan Bowles is executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York\textendash based think tank focused on expanding economic opportunity.

However, the U.S. highway infrastructure suffers from insufficient maintenance creating inefficiencies such as increased travel times and increase in accidents. The means to fund the infrastructure and their maintenance is a point of debate. In this paper, we examine the role of political institutions and decision-making on the quality of highway infrastructure by focusing on the role of fiscal decentralization. Using generalized linear model estimation on state data from 1992 to 2012, we find evidence that fiscal decentralization improves infrastructure quality. These results are robust to the choice of control variables and method of estimation. (JEL D73, H42, H72)},

Following an acceleration of public investment over the last 15 years, the stock of infrastructure assets increased in LIDCs, even though large gaps remain compared to emerging markets. Infrastructure in LIDCs is largely provided by the public sector; private participation is mostly channeled through Public-Private Partnerships. Grants and concessional loans are an essential source of infrastructure funding in LIDCs, while the complementary role of bank lending is still limited to a few countries. Bridging infrastructure gaps would require a broad set of actions to improve the efficiency of public spending, mobilize domestic resources and support from development partners, and crowd in the private sector.},

The goal of this research is to design and develop an ANN model in order to achieve a successful prediction of road deterioration as a tool for maintenance planning activities. Such a model is part of the proposed decision support concept for urban road infrastructure management and a decision support tool in planning activities. The input data were obtained from Circly 6.0 Pavement Design Software and used to determine the stress values (560 testing combinations). It was found that it is possible and desirable to apply such a model in the decision support concept in order to improve urban road infrastructure maintenance planning processes.},

The analysis considers disaster effects by combining the following four dimensions: 1) short-, medium-, and long-term impacts, 2) disaster severity, categorized as catastrophic (CAT) or non-catastrophic (NCAT), 3) disaster type: hydro-meteorological, geophysical, and other specific disaster types, and 4) four income groups. The results show that the impacts of a disaster event on economic growth vary depending on the time frame, severity, disaster type, and income level. Overall, CAT disasters have negative impacts regardless of the time frame, while NCAT disasters may have positive impacts depending on the disaster type. The results also indicate that economic growth in lower-middle-income countries is most sensitive to natural disasters, but developed countries also experience negative impacts from CAT disasters.},

This study employs the pooled mean group (PMG) approach to examine economic growth in the aftermath of floods in 14 non-special category states in India using flood disaster data over the period 1981\textendash 2011. The PMG estimates show that flood impacts in terms of area affected, the population affected, and economic losses due to floods decline real per capita GSDP growth in the long run after taking into account growth-enhancing factors. Moreover, instrumental variables (IV)-two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimates also confirm that states experience lower real per capita GSDP growth due to higher flood impacts. The results, further, show that higher urbanization and enrollment of higher education increases real per capita GSDP growth in the long run. For robustness check, the study investigates the impact of floods on real per capita GSDP growth after taking into account government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption. The PMG and IV-2SLS estimates produce same results and confirm that flood impacts reduce real per capita GSDP growth, while government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption enhances real per capita GSDP growth. Overall, results confirm that flood management policies are essential to minimize the adverse impacts of floods on the growth of real per capita GSDP.},

Additionally, options for further internalisation should be identified. As input for this assessment, an overview of transport infrastructure costs is provided by this study. More specifically, this study aims to provide total, average and marginal infrastructure cost figures for road transport, rail transport, inland waterways transport (IWT), maritime transport and aviation in the EU28 Member States and some other Western countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, the US states California and Missouri, the Canadian provinces Alberta and British Columbia, and Japan). These infrastructure cost figures are estimated for 2016. For road, rail and IWT, the costs of the entire national (or state/province) transport network were estimated. For aviation and maritime transport, on the other hand, infrastructure costs for some specific ports and airports were estimated. In addition to an overview of transport infrastructure costs, this study also assesses the development in infrastructure expenditures for road, rail and inland navigation transport over the period 1995-2016.},
