Si tratta di una tecnologia innovativa messa a punto in collaborazione con Leica Geosystems Italia. Il progetto prevede la realizzazione di un sistema integrato di sensori capaci di acquisire ad altissima risoluzione immagini e geometrie di tutta la galleria, nonch\'e lo sviluppo di nuove piattaforme software di analisi dei dati acquisiti. Immagini e misure sono infatti elaborate sia per essere utilizzate da un algoritmo ad intelligenza artificiale per il riconoscimento di difetti e anomalie dell'opera, sia per ricostruire sotto forma di realt\`a virtuale l'ambiente galleria e trasferirlo in ufficio (attraverso un visore VR) per poter poi essere visitato e analizzato da occhi esperti in qualsiasi momento e ogni volta che se ne ha la necessit\`a. L'acquisizione dei dati avviene attraverso un mezzo stradale che prevede l'installazione fissa di videocamere ad altissima risoluzione, sistemi di illuminazione e sistemi di rilievo di precisione delle geometrie delle gallerie. Tale configurazione consente l'utilizzo del mezzo in qualsiasi condizione di luce, senza l'interruzione della circolazione in totale sicurezza per il traffico e per gli operatori. Il sistema di riconoscimento delle immagini  \`e di tipo machine learning ossia migliora la risposta man mano che la quantit\`a di informazioni disponibili cresce e quindi produttivit\`a e affidabilit\`a miglioreranno tanto pi\`u velocemente quanto pi\`u sar\`a possibile utilizzare questi strumenti.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Existing infrastructure needs major investment (photo: Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office) Governor Cuomo traveled to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Trump, where he pitched the president on infrastructure investments like an expanded Second Avenue Subway and a new Penn Station. The governor is right to push for a national public works program, which would get thousands of newly unemployed Americans working again while tackling urgent infrastructure needs.~ The last time the nation embarked on a major public works program, it produced dozens of large-scale projects in New York that helped dig the city and the country out of the Great Depression\textemdash from the RFK Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel, and LaGuardia Airport to post offices, hospitals, high schools, and swimming pools across every borough. A bold public works program would give New York a similar boost during these devastating economic times. But New York's infrastructure needs are different than they were during the 1930s. Today, what the city needs most is a massive campaign to upgrade and maintain the infrastructure it already has.~ For decades, New York City has fallen behind the mounting state-of-good-repair needs of its crumbling public infrastructure, with serious consequences for the city's livability and long-term health. For instance, while building new miles of subway is a worthy goal, the urgent need is to stabilize the current system. Fixing the city's crumbling subways and modernizing the bus system will require at least \$40 billion over the next five years, including \$7 billion just to upgrade decades-old signals and cut down on delays. These investments can restore confidence in public transit in a moment of crisis\textemdash and with the system shut at night and the city on lockdown, now is the time to get to work. New York City's aging infrastructure needs extend far beyond public transit. The city's beleaguered public housing\textemdash home to a disproportionate share of residents impacted by the current crisis\textemdash is waiting on more than \$31 billion in urgent infrastructure repairs, including crucial fixes to moldering apartments and crumbling facades.~ The city's average public hospital\textemdash essential to the pandemic response\textemdash is over 57 years old, and the system is staring down nearly \$400 million in critical repair and maintenance costs. The city's public parks\textemdash especially vital now that New Yorkers have few other options for recreation and exercise\textemdash are more than 73 years old, on average, and face more than \$634 million in needs, including decaying drainage systems, crumbling retaining walls, and disintegrating bulkheads.~ Parks are far from the city's only green infrastructure challenges. Thousands of acres of concrete and asphalt need to be greened to reduce stormwater runoff. And meeting the city's ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require fast-tracked upgrades to retrofit far more public buildings.~ Many of these assets receive little notice until they fail. Over the past decade, the city has averaged 459 water main breaks annually, more than one per day. The number of fracture-critical bridges jumped from 47 in 2012 to at least 67 in 2018.~ Add to the list the stunning repair needs affecting the city's public schools, colleges, and libraries\textemdash institutions that provide a sense of community in neighborhoods citywide, while preparing New Yorkers to participate in the economic recovery. The Department of Education has nearly \$2.5 billion in urgent, short-term capital needs, with over \$100 million more at CUNY's community colleges. And the city's three public library systems\textemdash where the average branch library is more than 65 years old\textemdash are facing nearly \$900 million in capital expenses to overhaul aging branches, replace leaky roofs, fix broken boilers, and upgrade HVAC systems. In addition, these institutions and many others need major upgrades to expand broadband access and help close the city's persistent digital divide. As the city at the epicenter of a national catastrophe, New York will need a historic level of federal investment to restore livelihoods and restart the country's largest local economy, with lasting benefits for the nation and the world. Investing in infrastructure is a vital place to start.~ But in a city as old as New York, the first priority should be repairing, restoring, and modernizing the aging infrastructure that we've already got. There's no shortage of shovel-ready work to do. ***Jonathan Bowles is executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York\textendash based think tank focused on expanding economic opportunity.

  abstract = {Fiscal adjustment becomes like walking up the down escalator when growth-promoting spending is cut so much as to lower growth and thus the present value of future tax revenues to a degree that more than offsets the improvement in the cash deficit. Although short-term cash flows matter, a preponderant focus on them encourages governments to invest too little. Cash flow targets also encourage governments to shift investment spending off budget, by seeking private investment in public projects\textemdash irrespective of its real fiscal or economic benefits. To evade the action of cash flow targets, some have suggested excluding from their scope certain investments (such as those undertaken by public enterprises deemed commercial or financed by multilaterals). These stopgap remedies might sometimes help protect investment, but they do not provide a satisfactory solution to the underlying problem. Governments can more effectively reduce the biases created by the focus on short-term cash flows by developing indicators of the long-term fiscal effects of their decisions, including accounting and economic measures of net worth, and where appropriate including such measures in fiscal targets or even fiscal rules, replacing the exclusive focus on liquidity and debt.},

  abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as a new organizational form to provide public infrastructure over the last 30 years. Governments find them attractive because PPPs can be used to avoid fiscal check-and-balances and increase spending. At the same time, PPPs can lead to important efficiency gains, especially for transportation infrastructure. These gains include better maintenance, reduced bureaucratic costs, and filtering white elephants. For these gains to materialize, it is necessary to deal with the governance of PPPs, which is more demanding than for the public provision of infrastructure. The governance can be improved by the use of contracts with appropriate risk allocation and by avoiding opportunistic renegotiations, which have been pervasive. The good news is that, based on the experience with PPPs over the last three decades, we have learnt how to address these challenges.},

However, the U.S. highway infrastructure suffers from insufficient maintenance creating inefficiencies such as increased travel times and increase in accidents. The means to fund the infrastructure and their maintenance is a point of debate. In this paper, we examine the role of political institutions and decision-making on the quality of highway infrastructure by focusing on the role of fiscal decentralization. Using generalized linear model estimation on state data from 1992 to 2012, we find evidence that fiscal decentralization improves infrastructure quality. These results are robust to the choice of control variables and method of estimation. (JEL D73, H42, H72)},

  abstract = {This paper argues that, while most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have managed to significantly improve the short-term efficiency of their infrastructure services since the widespread liberalization of the 1990s, they have been slow to ensure a fair distribution of the gains. They have also been slow in making the investments needed to ensure the prospects of future generations, including by protecting the environment for the long term. The paper places at least part of the blame on regulatory failures. It also shows how past mistakes can be corrected by the significant sectoral transformations, driven by new technologies, now underway. Digitalization is altering the economic characteristics of infrastructure services. Resulting changes in governance and financing options demand adjustments to economic regulations, including by broadening the regulatory toolkit to integrate new insights offered by developments in behavioral economics.},

Good practice entails: (a) Consistent definition and measurement of overrun; in contrast to mixing inconsistent baselines, price levels, etc. (b) Data collection that includes all valid and reliable data; as opposed to including idiosyncratically sampled data, data with removed outliers, non-valid data from consultancies, etc. (c) Recognition that cost overrun is systemically fat-tailed; in contrast to understanding overrun in terms of error and randomness. (d) Acknowledgment that the root cause of cost overrun is behavioral bias; in contrast to explanations in terms of scope changes, complexity, etc. (e) De-biasing cost estimates with reference class forecasting or similar methods based in behavioral science; as opposed to conventional methods of estimation, with their century-long track record of inaccuracy and systemic bias. Bad practice is characterized by violating at least one of these five points. Love and Ahiaga-Dagbui violate all five. In so doing, they produce an exceptionally useful and comprehensive catalog of the many pitfalls that exist, and must be avoided, for properly understanding and curbing cost overrun.},

There is a need for understanding what a ``sustainable pavement'' would entail in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Since environmental impact assessment of major projects is becoming mandatory in many countries, various research projects attempt to evaluate the environmental impact of different pavement materials, technologies, or processes over the road life cycle. To support these efforts, there is a need to measure and describe different aspects of sustainability related to road pavements. In particular, keeping road pavements at high service levels through a preventive maintenance approach during the pavement service life has been proven to provide significant improvement of their performance and reduce their deterioration rate.},

Grants and concessional loans are an essential source of infrastructure funding in LIDCs, while the complementary role of bank lending is still limited to a few countries.

We also compare the current practices with those found in the 2001 Government Performance Project (GPP) analysis. Interviews with 20 officials in 12 counties revealed six themes. Four of these are concerned with maintenance challenges: the economic environment, politics, human resources, and information systems. The other two themes relate to efforts that have been made by these counties to enhance maintenance through cost management and additional funding. Overall, we found that asset maintenance in these counties was negatively affected by the Great Recession, and that there is still a substantial level of unfunded maintenance, which is only slightly better than what was reported in the GPP, despite a recent focus on improvements.},

The goal of this research is to design and develop an ANN model in order to achieve a successful prediction of road deterioration as a tool for maintenance planning activities. Such a model is part of the proposed decision support concept for urban road infrastructure management and a decision support tool in planning activities. The input data were obtained from Circly 6.0 Pavement Design Software and used to determine the stress values (560 testing combinations). It was found that it is possible and desirable to apply such a model in the decision support concept in order to improve urban road infrastructure maintenance planning processes.},

The analysis considers disaster effects by combining the following four dimensions: 1) short-, medium-, and long-term impacts, 2) disaster severity, categorized as catastrophic (CAT) or non-catastrophic (NCAT), 3) disaster type: hydro-meteorological, geophysical, and other specific disaster types, and 4) four income groups. The results show that the impacts of a disaster event on economic growth vary depending on the time frame, severity, disaster type, and income level. Overall, CAT disasters have negative impacts regardless of the time frame, while NCAT disasters may have positive impacts depending on the disaster type. The results also indicate that economic growth in lower-middle-income countries is most sensitive to natural disasters, but developed countries also experience negative impacts from CAT disasters.},

This study employs the pooled mean group (PMG) approach to examine economic growth in the aftermath of floods in 14 non-special category states in India using flood disaster data over the period 1981\textendash 2011. The PMG estimates show that flood impacts in terms of area affected, the population affected, and economic losses due to floods decline real per capita GSDP growth in the long run after taking into account growth-enhancing factors. Moreover, instrumental variables (IV)-two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimates also confirm that states experience lower real per capita GSDP growth due to higher flood impacts. The results, further, show that higher urbanization and enrollment of higher education increases real per capita GSDP growth in the long run. For robustness check, the study investigates the impact of floods on real per capita GSDP growth after taking into account government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption. The PMG and IV-2SLS estimates produce same results and confirm that flood impacts reduce real per capita GSDP growth, while government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption enhances real per capita GSDP growth. Overall, results confirm that flood management policies are essential to minimize the adverse impacts of floods on the growth of real per capita GSDP.},

  abstract = {Can greater investment in infrastructure raise U.S. long-run output? Are infrastructure projects a good short-run stimulus to the economy? This paper uses insights from the macroeconomics literature to address these questions. I begin by analyzing the effects of government investment in both a stylized neoclassical model and a medium-scale New Keynesian model, highlighting the economic mechanisms that govern the strength of the short-run and long-run impacts. The analysis confirms earlier findings that the implementation delays inherent in infrastructure projects reduce short-run multipliers in most cases. In contrast, long-run multipliers can be sizable when government capital is productive. Moreover, these multipliers are greater if the economy starts from a point below the socially optimal amount of public capital. Turning to empirical estimation, I use the theoretical model to explain the econometric challenges to estimating the elasticity of output to public infrastructure. Using both artificial data generated by simulations of the model and extensions of existing empirical work, I demonstrate how both general equilibrium effects and optimal choice of public capital are likely to impart upward biases to output elasticity estimates. Finally, I review and extend some empirical estimates of the shortrun effects, focusing on infrastructure spending in the ARRA.},

I first discuss the new innovations in methodology and various strengths and weaknesses of the main approaches to estimating fiscal multipliers. Reviewing the estimates, I come to the surprising conclusion that the bulk of the estimates for average spending and tax change multipliers lie in a fairly narrow range, 0.6 to 1 for spending multipliers and -2 to -3 for tax change multipliers. However, I identify economic circumstances in which multipliers lie outside those ranges. Finally, I review the debate on whether multipliers were higher for the 2009 Obama stimulus spending in the United States or for fiscal consolidations in Europe.},

First, the optimal level of maintenance is shown to depend on the size of new investments as a share of existing public infrastructure and on the productivity of infrastructure. Second, the model is parameterized and solved numerically for a sample of Latin American countries. Quantitative results show that reallocating funds from new infrastructure to maintenance can have positive effects on these countries' GDP.},

The attention is focused particularly on post-emergency situations related to effects on transportation networks caused by extraordinary events; the effects are considered with reference to bridges. Addressing the transition from physical effects to functional effects (relating to mobility) on the single infrastructure element calls for a commitment which has appeared challenging in view of the strongly innovative content involved. The analysis process consists in different steps. At the first step an effort must be made in order to acquire knowledge about the characteristics of the set of infrastructures (bridges) and about a set of possible seismic scenarios. By using fragility curves of bridges, the damage state of the network links (in which bridges are included) can be obtained. By making a series of hypotheses on how a bridge damage state can influence links' functionality, a set of ``damaged'' (lower capacity) road network models has been carried out. At the next step of the process, interaction between transportation supply and demand, by way of static or dynamic traffic assignment models, allows to measure the performance of the system, or rather, its overall response to extraordinary events using suitable performance indexes. Then, the network risk curve (probability of the seismic action vs. transportation system performance indexes) is derived. At the end of the process a cost-effective retrofit strategy has been identified. The procedure has been applied to a test network at regional scale in the north-east of Italy.},

More specifically, this study aims to provide total, average and marginal infrastructure cost figures for road transport, rail transport, inland waterways transport (IWT), maritime transport and aviation in the EU28 Member States and some other Western countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, the US states California and Missouri, the Canadian provinces Alberta and British Columbia, and Japan). These infrastructure cost figures are estimated for 2016. For road, rail and IWT, the costs of the entire national (or state/province) transport network were estimated. For aviation and maritime transport, on the other hand, infrastructure costs for some specific ports and airports were estimated. In addition to an overview of transport infrastructure costs, this study also assesses the development in infrastructure expenditures for road, rail and inland navigation transport over the period 1995-2016.},

A literature review on risk assessment in road asset management has been carried out and several European road administrations have been interviewed on the current practice of risk assessment in their asset management procedures. Based on asset-specific risk assessment considering pavement, structures, drainage, tunnels, road furniture and geotechnical assets, a procedure for the transformation and accumulation of these risks onto network level is an essential part of the project. X-ARA will enable a road administration to execute a risk-based assessment and comparison of different maintenance strategies on network level, and then ``overlay'' the effects of broad influencing factors to assess ``what if'' outcomes. In considering a bottom-up-approach (from object level to network-level) the risk can be calculated and finally cumulated by using asset-specific information, which are available for most of the European road administrations.},

Recent studies have shown that an increase of the existing budget of 80\% is necessary to avoid progressive deterioration. To support the efforts to increase the maintenance budgets an additional study for pavements was conducted to assess the effect of postponing maintenance on the later maintenance needs. A clear relation was found between the duration of the do-nothing-period and the additional investments to compensate the deterioration of the pavement and the reduction of the asset value occurred in the meantime. These additional budgetary needs range between 25\% after a do-nothing-period of 5 years and 150\% after 9 years. Thus for the first time based on LCC-calculations it could be shown that periodic condition related maintenance has an economic advantage against do-nothing-strategies with subsequent improvement.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a floating-interest-rate infrastructure bond, where the interest of a government bond is paid to investors during the period of construction and the early period of operation. Unlike the usual government bond, which provides a fixed interest rate, the proposed floating-interest-rate infrastructure bond pays a floating interest, the rate of which depends on spillover tax revenues. Effective infrastructure projects have a positive effect on the economic growth of a region, known as the spillover effect. When user charges and the return from spillover tax revenues are below the fixed rate of the government bond, the interest rate will equal to the fixed rate of the government bond. In this case, investors in the infrastructure will receive interest on the government bond at the minimum rate. As the spillover effect of the infrastructure increases, the rate of return for infrastructure investment will become greater than the fixed rate of the government bond. The success of the floating-interest-rate infrastructure bond depends on the spillover effect and on transparency and accountability. Policy recommendations are provided in this paper on how to increase the spillover effect and improve transparency and accountability.},
